## Palindrome Number ##

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it reads the same backward as forward.

Return true if the number is a palindrome, otherwise, return false.

function isPalindrome(n) {
    var og = n;
    var rev = 0;
    while(n > 0) {
        var dig = n % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + dig;
        n = Math.floor(n / 10);
    }
    if(og == rev) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

if(isPalindrome(8768768768)) {
    console.log("Number is palindrome!");
} else {
    console.log("Number is not palindrome!");
}

/*Your function `isPalindrome(n)` checks whether a given number `n` is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number (or string) that reads the same forward as backward.

The function works correctly and efficiently using a while loop to reverse the number and then comparing the original number with the reversed version.
*/

//Here's a breakdown of the code:

 `var og = n;`
//1. **Initialization**: `var og = n;` initializes a variable `og` to store the original number.

//2. **Reversing the Number**:
   ```javascript
   while (n > 0) {
       var dig = n % 10;
       rev = rev * 10 + dig;
       n = Math.floor(n / 10);
   }
   ```
   //This loop iterates through each digit of the original number (`n`), reverses it, and stores the reversed number in the variable `rev`.

//3. **Checking for Palindrome**:
   ```javascript
   if (og == rev) {
       return true;
   } else {
       return false;
   }
   ```
   //It compares the original number `og` with the reversed number `rev`. If they are equal, the function returns `true`, indicating that the input number is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

//The logic is correct and efficient. It would work for both positive and non-negative integers. Well done!

/*Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the `isPalindrome` function.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the function is determined by the while loop, where we reverse the number by iterating through its digits.

In the worst case, the while loop iterates through each digit of the input number `n`. Let's say the number `n` has \(d\) digits. Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(d)\) or \(O(\log_{10}(n))\) in terms of the input number \(n\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the function is constant because the amount of extra memory used does not depend on the input size. We use a few variables (`og`, `rev`, `dig`) to store intermediate values, but the number of these variables remains constant regardless of the size of the input.

Hence, the space complexity is \(O(1)\), indicating constant space usage.
*/

/*Your `isPalindrome` function is already efficient and clear in its logic. However, we can suggest a few improvements to enhance readability and maintainability:

1. **Function Naming and Parameter Type**: Consider using descriptive function names and specifying the parameter type to improve code clarity and maintainability.

2. **Simplified Return**: You can simplify the return statements by directly returning the comparison result.
*/

//Here's an updated version with these improvements:

```javascript
/**
 * Checks if a given number is a palindrome.
 * @param {number} num - The number to check for palindrome.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the number is a palindrome, false otherwise.
 */
function isPalindrome(num) {
    const originalNum = num;
    let reversedNum = 0;

    while (num > 0) {
        const digit = num % 10;
        reversedNum = reversedNum * 10 + digit;
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
    }

    return originalNum === reversedNum;
}
```

//These improvements enhance code readability and adherence to common JavaScript style conventions. The function remains efficient and effectively checks for palindromes.

/*A more efficient approach to determine whether a number is a palindrome is to reverse only half of the number and compare it with the other half. This way, you only need to traverse half the number of digits, which improves the time complexity.

Here's the efficient approach:

1. **Get the Reversed Half**: While reversing the entire number, we can simultaneously compare the reversed half with the remaining half to check for a palindrome.

2. **Comparison**: We start reversing the digits of the given number while keeping track of the reversed half. We then compare this reversed half with the remaining half of the number. For numbers with an odd number of digits, we divide by 10 before the comparison.

3. **Palindrome Check**: If the two halves match, the number is a palindrome.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

**Example:**
Consider the number 1221.

- Initially, `reversedHalf = 0` and `num = 1221`.
- In each iteration:
  - `reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + (num % 10)` (reversing the right half)
  - `num = Math.floor(num / 10)` (moving to the next digit from the left)

| `reversedHalf` | `num`  |
|----------------|--------|
| 1              | 122    |
| 12             | 12     |
| 121            | 1      |

In the end, `reversedHalf = 121` and `num = 1`. Since `reversedHalf` is equal to the remaining `num`, we conclude that the number is a palindrome.
*/

//Now, let's implement this more efficient solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(num) {
    // Handle negative numbers and numbers ending with 0 (except 0 itself)
    if (num < 0 || (num % 10 === 0 && num !== 0)) {
        return false;
    }

    let reversedHalf = 0;

    while (num > reversedHalf) {
        reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + (num % 10);
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
    }

    // For numbers with an odd number of digits, remove the middle digit
    return num === reversedHalf || num === Math.floor(reversedHalf / 10);
}
```

//This approach reduces the time complexity to \(O(\log_{10}(n))\) since we only iterate through half of the digits in the number, making it more efficient.
